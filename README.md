## Overview
The Smart Water Fountain System is a solution designed to ensure our cats always have access to fresh, flowing water. Using Sparkfun Load Cells for water level monitoring, this system gives visual and audible cues to pet owners as a reminder to refill the fountain.

## Background Information
As full-time college students, we are busy and out of the house often. Sometimes, we notice our cats' water fountain has stopped flowing from the spout because the water level is so low. However, we do not know how long it has stopped or how long they have gone without water unless we physically check inside the fountain. We did not want to have to buy a different fountain that has a water level guage since our cats are already used to their current one. Therefore, we decided to build a system that would notify us of the water level visually and audibly remind us to refill it. This ensures they will have access to fresh water and reduce the risk of dehydration, which cats are more prone to.

## Part 1 Instructions (Soldering Load Cells to Combinator Board)
1. Prepare the work area.
   - Clear a workspace for soldering.
   - Heat your soldering iron to the appropriate temperature (We used 650Â°F for lead-free solder).
2. Strip and Tin the Load Cell wires.
   - Use wire strippers to carefully strip 1-2cm of insulation from the ends of the wires coming from each load sensor (should be 12 total).
   - Twist the wires several times then apply a small amount of solder to the stripped ends of each wire.
3. Solder the Load Cell Wires to the Combinator Board.
   - We used four 3-wire load sensors which match the Combinator Board as such:

     - Make sure to keep track of which load sensors are placed where in regards to Upper Left (UL), Upper Right (UR), Lower Left (LL) and Lower Right (LR).

4. Ensure connections are good by inspection and gently tugging on each wire to make sure they are secure.

## Part 2 Instructions (Structural Setup)
1. Take 1 flat, sturdy platform and align each load cell equidistant from each other on top.
   - ![image](https://github.com/catherinextan/ECE4180-Smart-Water-Fountain-System/assets/65838825/d76bbcea-90ce-4c36-906d-068f81e08905)
2. Place the second flat, sturdy platform on top of the load cells and ensure the point of contact is equal on all 4. This will act as the "scale" to weigh the water fountain and guage the water level.

   - We actually switched out our top platform for a even more sturdy cardboard one so that even pressure would be applied to all load cells (the sheet metal was lifting at the corners and sinking in the middle when heavy objects were placed on it)

## Part 3 Instructions (Hardware Setup)
1. Wire the Load Cell Combinator Board to the Load Cell Amplifier HX711. 

| Combinator  | Amplifier HX711 |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| RED  | RED  |
| BLK  | BLK  |
| WHT  | WHT  |
| GRN  | GRN  |
| YLW  | YLW  |
2. Wire the Load Cell Amplifier HX711 to the mbed LPC1768

| Amplifier HX711  | mbed |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| VCC  | 3.3V Vout  |
| DAT  | p5  |
| CLK  | p6  |
| GND  | GND  |
3. Wire the RGB LED to the mbed LPC1768
   - **note that our RGB LED had a common cathode going to GND**
   - **also ensure that each R/G/B pin on the LED is connected in series with 100Ohm resistor**

| RGB LED  | mbed |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| R pin  | p21  |
| common cathode  | GND  |
| G pin  | p22  |
| B pin  | p23  |
4. Wire the Speaker to the Class D Audio Amp

| Speaker  | Class D Audio Amp |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| +  | out+  |
| -  | out-  |
5. Wire the Class D Audio Amp to the mbed LPC1768

| Class D Audio Amp  | mbed |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| pwr-  | GND  |
| in-  | GND  |
| pwr+  | 3.3V Vout  |
| in+  | p18  |
| S  | p14  |

Once everything is wired up, write the code for the mbed and build it. Once the hardware is setup, and the software is launched, the system will automatically start after the scale tares itself.

## Part 4 Instructions (Software for mbed)
1. Import the library for the Load Cell Amplifier HX711 so that it will work with mbed.
   - We used Keil Studio IDE so we also had to add an "mbed_app.json" file that included this code snippet: 
```
{
    "target_overrides": {
      "*": {
        "target.printf_lib": "std"
      }
    }
}
```
